This script allows you to upload a file to VirusTotal for analysis and retrieve the results using their API. It uses Python libraries requests, json, and colorama for handling HTTP requests, JSON parsing, and colored console output, respectively.


## Features

- Uploads a file for scanning.
- Retrieves detailed analysis, including file name, size, description, and SHA-256 hash.
- Displays antivirus scan results with categorized verdicts.
- Highlights if any antivirus detects the file as malicious.
